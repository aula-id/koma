//! [`SessionRuntime`]: the per-session EXECUTION state carved out of
//! [`super::AppStateRest`].
//!
//! This holds everything tied to ONE session's in-flight turn: its [`Session`],
//! the streaming buffers, the tool-approval / deferred-task / sub-agent state
//! machines, the shared dir cache, and the cache-warmth bookkeeping. Splitting
//! it out is the structural groundwork for running several concurrent sessions
//! later — for now there is always exactly ONE `SessionRuntime` (the foreground
//! one) and behaviour is identical to before the split.
//!
//! Streaming-lifecycle methods (`begin_stream`, `append_token`,
//! `append_reasoning`, `take_stream`, `take_reasoning`) live here because they
//! operate purely on the moved `streaming` / `stream_reasoning` buffers.
